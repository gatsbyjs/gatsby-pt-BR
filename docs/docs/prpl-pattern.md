title: PRPL Pattern
---

## What is PRPL?

PRPL is a web site architecture developed by Google for building websites and
apps that work exceptionally well on smartphones and other devices with
unreliable network connections.

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/

PRPL stands for:

- **Push** critical resources for the initial URL route using `<link preload>`
  and HTTP/2.
- **Render** initial route.
- **Pre-cache** remaining routes.
- **Lazy-load** and create remaining routes on demand.

_**Note** HTTP/2 Server Push is a developing server technology and not available on
most hosts just yet._

## Gatsby and PRPL

Gatsby follows the PRPL architectural pattern. Gatsby sites _render_ a static
HTML version of the initial route and then load the code bundle for the page.
Then immediately starts _pre-caching_ resources for pages linked to from the
initial route. When a user clicks on a link, Gatsby creates the new page _on
demand_ on the client.

This issue written at the start of Gatsby's 1.0 work provides further background
on how Gatsby works to guarantee high performance.
