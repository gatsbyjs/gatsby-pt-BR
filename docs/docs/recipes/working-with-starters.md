[Starters](/docs/starters/) are boilerplate Gatsby sites maintained officially, or by the community.

## Using a starter

### Prerequisites

- The [Gatsby CLI](/docs/gatsby-cli) installed

### Directions

1. Find the starter you'd like to use. (_The [Starter Library](/starters/?v=2) is a good place to look!_)

2. Generate a new site based on the starter. In the terminal, run:

```shell
gatsby new {your-project-name} {link-to-starter}
```

> _Don't run the above command as-is -- remember to replace {your-project-name} and {link-to-starter}!_

3. Run your new site:

```shell
cd {your-project-name}
gatsby develop
```
