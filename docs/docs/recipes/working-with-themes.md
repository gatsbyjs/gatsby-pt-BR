A [Gatsby theme](/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes) abstracts Gatsby configuration (shared functionality, data sourcing, design) into an installable package. This means that the configuration and functionality isnâ€™t directly written into your project, but rather versioned, centrally managed, and installed as a dependency. You can seamlessly update a theme, compose themes together, and even swap out one compatible theme for another.

## Creating a new site using a theme

Found a theme you'd like to use on your project? Awesome! You can configure it for use by following the steps below.

> If you'd like to take a look at more theme options, check out [list of themes](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=gatsby-theme).

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the [Gatsby CLI](/docs/gatsby-cli) installed

### Directions

1. Create a gatsby site

```shell
gatsby new {your-project-name}
```

2. Change directory and install theme

In this example, our theme is `gatsby-theme-blog`. You can replace that reference with whatever your theme is named.

```shell
cd {your-project-name}
npm install gatsby-theme-blog
```

3. Add theme to `gatsby.config.js`

Follow the instructions found in the README of the theme you're using to determine what configuration it requires.

```shell
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-blog`,
      options: {
        /*
        - basePath defaults to `/`
        - contentPath defaults to `content/posts`
        - assetPath defaults to `content/assets`
        - mdx defaults to `true`
        */
        basePath: `/blog`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

4. Run `gatsby develop` , the theme should be available at `http://localhost:8000/{basePath}`

> To learn how to further customize a theme, check out the available paths on [Gatsby-theme-blog Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-blog).

### Additional resources

- To learn how to further customize a theme, check out the docs on [Gatsby theme shadowing.](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/)

- You can also [use multiple themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-multiple-gatsby-themes/) on a project.

## Creating a new site using a theme starter

Creating a site based on a starter that configures a theme follows the same process as creating a site based on a starter that **doesn't** configure a theme. In this example you can use the [starter for creating a new site that uses the official Gatsby blog theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme).

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the [Gatsby CLI](/docs/gatsby-cli) installed

### Directions

1. Generate a new site based on the blog theme starter:

```shell
gatsby new {your-project-name} https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

2. Run your new site:

```shell
cd {your-project-name}
gatsby develop
```

### Additional resources

- Learn how to use an existing Gatsby theme in the [shorter conceptual guide](/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme) or the more detailed [step-by-step tutorial](/tutorial/using-a-theme).
