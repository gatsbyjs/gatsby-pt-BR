Showtime. Once you are happy with your site, you are ready to go live with it!

## Preparing for deployment

### Prerequisites

- A [Gatsby site](/docs/quick-start)
- The [Gatsby CLI](/docs/gatsby-cli) installed

### Directions

1. Stop your development server if it is running (`Ctrl + C` on your command line in most cases)

2. For the standard site path at the root directory (`/`), run `gatsby build` using the Gatsby CLI on the command line. The built files will now be in the `public` folder.

```shell
gatsby build
```

3. To include a site path other than `/` (such as `/site-name/`), set a path prefix by adding the following to your `gatsby-config.js` and replacing `yourpathprefix` with your desired path prefix:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  pathPrefix: `/yourpathprefix`,
}
```

There are a few reasons to do this -- for instance, hosting a blog built with Gatsby on a domain with another site not built on Gatsby. The main site would direct to `example.com`, and the Gatsby site with a path prefix could live at `example.com/blog`.

4. With a path prefix set in `gatsby-config.js`, run `gatsby build` with the `--prefix-paths` flag to automatically add the prefix to the beginning of all Gatsby site URLs and `<Link>` tags.

```shell
gatsby build --prefix-paths
```

5. Make sure that your site looks the same when running `gatsby build` as with `gatsby develop`. By running `gatsby serve` when you build your site, you can test out (and debug if necessary) the finished product before deploying it live.

```shell
gatsby build && gatsby serve
```
