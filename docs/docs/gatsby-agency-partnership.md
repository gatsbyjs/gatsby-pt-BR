If you're in the business of building websites or web apps for clients, and you're building with Gatsby, we're building an Agency Partnership Program to get the support you need and the visibility you deserve.

## What's provided

Depending on the amount of websites you build with Gatsby, the partner program will include:

- Joint case studies that are highlighted on the Gatsby blog, website, and other channels
- Dedicated page on Gatsbyjs.org showcasing the sites you’ve built with Gatsby
- A lead capture form on this page so people can get in touch with you directly
- Live training for developers (in-person or virtual)

## Application process
