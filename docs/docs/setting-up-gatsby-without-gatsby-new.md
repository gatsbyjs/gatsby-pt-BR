title: Setting up a Gatsby Site Without the `gatsby new` Command
---

There are many Enterprise level companies that maintain an internal clone of the NPM registry for security purposes. If you work for such a company, you may find that you are able to successfully run `npm install -g gatsby-cli` but cannot run the `gatsby new <project-source>` as the `gatsby new` command clones a repo from a public GitHub repository. Many companies block public GitHub, which will cause the `gatsby new` command to fail. Not to worry, though, you can set up a new Gatsby site without the `gatsby new` command with a few quick steps.

## Preparing your environment

To get started with Gatsby, youâ€™ll need to make sure you have the following software tools installed:

1. [Node.js](/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs)
1. [npm CLI](/tutorial/part-zero/#familiarize-with-npm)
1. [Gatsby CLI](/tutorial/part-zero/#install-the-gatsby-cli)

For step-by-step installation instructions and detailed explanations of the required software, head on over to the [Gatsby tutorial](/tutorial/part-zero/).

After your developer environment is set up, you'll want to set up a new project folder.

```shell
mkdir my-new-gatsby-site
cd my-new-gatsby-site
```

Next, you'll need to set up NPM within your project.

```shell
npm init
```

Fill out the prompts for the `package.json` file that is generated. If you'd like to skip that, you can run `npm init -y` and a pre-filled `package.json` will be generated for you.

Now, you'll need to install the necessary packages that Gatsby relies on to work its magic.

```shell
npm install --save gatsby react react-dom
```

Next, you'll add a `src` directory and a `pages` directory inside your project.

```shell
mkdir src
cd src
mkdir pages
```

Inside the pages directory, you'll make an `index.js` file that exports a React component.

```shell
cd pages
touch index.js
```

Now, add some React code to your `index.js` file as a starting point for your project.

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
import React from "react"

export default () => <h1>Hello Gatsby!</h1>
```

Finally, go back to the root of your project and run the `gatsby develop` command to start a development server and begin coding.

```shell
cd ../../
gatsby develop
```

And that's it! You should now have your initial page running on `http://localhost:8000` with a GraphiQL IDE running on `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. From here, you can follow the rest of the [Gatsby tutorial](/tutorial/part-zero/#set-up-a-code-editor) starting with setting up a code editor to get the full experience of what Gatsby can offer.
