title: Using Client-Side Only Packages
---

On occasion, you may need to use a function or library that only works client-side. This usually is because the library in question accesses something that isn't available during server-side rendering (SSR), like [browser DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) methods.

You'll need to use one of the workarounds outlined below if your project fails to compile with `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build` with an error like:

```bash
Reference error: Window is not Defined
```

## Workaround 1: Use a different library or approach

Sometimes the simplest approach is to work around the problem. If you can re-implement your component using a plugin which _doesn't_ break SSR, that's probably best.

## Workaround 2: Add client-side package via CDN

In the component where you need it, load the package via CDN using a [`<script />`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) tag.

To embed your script, you can:

- Include it in a custom component as needed using [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).
- Add the script tag directly in your base HTML using Gatsby's [html.js](/docs/custom-html/)

You should then follow React's guidelines for [Integrating with DOM Manipulation Plugins](https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#integrating-with-dom-manipulation-plugins), using the methods available in the [React Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle) to interact with the library you're using.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet"

class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // set up and use external package as needed
    window.externalLibrary.method()
  }

  render(props) {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Helmet>
          <script src="https://cdn.example/path-to-external-library.js" />
        </Helmet>

        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        {/* etc */}
      </React.Fragment>
    )
  }
}
```

## Workaround 3: Load client-side dependent components with react-loadable

Install [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components) and use it as a wrapper for a component that wants to use a client-side only package.

```bash
npm install @loadable/component
# or use yarn
yarn add @loadable/component
```

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"

import Loadable from "@loadable/component"

// these two libraries are client-side only
import Client from "shopify-buy"
import ShopifyBuy from "@shopify/buy-button-js"

const ShopifyBuyButton = props => {
  // custom component using shopify client-side libraries
  return <div>etc</div>
}

const LoadableBuyButton = Loadable(() => import("./ShopifyBuyButton"))

export default LoadableBuyButton
```

## Workaround 4: Use React.lazy and Suspense on client-side only

React.lazy and Suspense are still not ready for server-side rendering, but they can still be used by checking that the code is executed only on the client.
While this solution is inferior to `loadable-components`, that works both on server side and client, it still provides an alternative for dealing with client-side only packages, without an added dependency.
Remember that the following code could break if executed without the `isSSR` guard.

```jsx
import React from "react"

const ClientSideOnlyLazy = React.lazy(() =>
  import("../components/ClientSideOnly")
)
const MyPage = () => {
  const isSSR = typeof window === "undefined"

  return (
    <>
      {!isSSR && (
        <React.Suspense fallback={<div />}>
          <ClientSideOnlyLazy />
        </React.Suspense>
      )}
    </>
  )
}
```
