title: "@reach/router and Gatsby"
---

This guide gives a peek under the hood of using `@reach/router` with Gatsby.

## Why do we use @reach/router?

The main reasons Gatsby uses `@reach/router` are:

1. Preloading. You can read more about preloading in the docs for the [Gatsby Link API](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/).
2. The [routing accessibility](https://reach.tech/router/accessibility) it provides.
3. It supports [server rendering](https://reach.tech/router/server-rendering) which helps Gatsby build routed files at build time.

With Gatsby, you will mostly be using the `<Link />` component provided by the `gatsby` package. The [`<Link />` API docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/) explain the relationship between `gatsby` `<Link />` and `@reach/router` `<Link />` very nicely:

> The component is a wrapper around @reach/router‚Äôs Link component that adds useful enhancements specific to Gatsby.

## Client and Server Routing ü§ù

Besides using the [`<Link />` API](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/) for linking between pages Gatsby generates, you can define your own client-side routes. See the [client only paths example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/client-only-paths) on how to use `<Router />` from `@reach/router` to make client routes work seamlessly together with your server routes.
