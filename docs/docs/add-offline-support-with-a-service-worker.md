title: Adding Offline Support with a Service Worker
---

If you've run an [audit with Lighthouse](/docs/audit-with-lighthouse/), you may have noticed a lackluster score in the "Progressive Web App" category. Let's address how you can improve that score.

1.  You can [add a manifest file](/docs/add-a-manifest-file/). Ensure that the manifest plugin is listed _before_ the offline plugin so that the offline plugin can cache the created `manifest.webmanifest`.
2.  You can also add offline support, since another requirement for a website to qualify as a PWA is the use of a [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). [Gatsby's offline plugin](/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline/) makes a Gatsby site work offline--and makes it more resistant to bad network conditions--by creating a service worker for your site.

## What is a service worker?

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. They increase your site availability in spotty connections, and are essential to making a nice user experience.

It supports features like push notifications and background synchronization.

## Using service workers in Gatsby with `gatsby-plugin-offline`

Gatsby provides an awesome plugin interface to create and load a service worker into your site: [gatsby-plugin-offline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-offline).

We recommend using this plugin together with the [manifest plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-manifest). (Donâ€™t forget to list the offline plugin after the manifest plugin so that the manifest file can be included in the service worker).

## Installing `gatsby-plugin-offline`

`npm install --save gatsby-plugin-offline`

Add this plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
{
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-manifest`,
      options: {
        ...
      }
    },
    'gatsby-plugin-offline'
  ]
}
```

That's all you need to add offline support to your Gatsby site.

Note: Service worker registers only in production builds (`gatsby build`).

## Displaying a message when a service worker updates

To display a custom message once your service worker finds an update, you can use the [`onServiceWorkerUpdateReady`](/docs/browser-apis/#onServiceWorkerUpdateReady) browser API in your `gatsby-browser.js` file. The following code will display a confirm prompt asking the user whether they would like to refresh the page when an update is found:

```javascript:title=gatsby-browser.js
export const onServiceWorkerUpdateReady = () => {
  const answer = window.confirm(
    `This application has been updated. ` +
      `Reload to display the latest version?`
  )

  if (answer === true) {
    window.location.reload()
  }
}
```

## Using a custom service worker in Gatsby

You can add a custom service worker if your use case requires something that `gatsby-plugin-offline` doesn't support.

Add a file called `sw.js` in the `static` folder.

Use the [`registerServiceWorker`](/docs/browser-apis/#registerServiceWorker) browser API in your `gatsby-browser.js` file.

```javascript:title=gatsby-browser.js
export const registerServiceWorker = () => true
```

That's all! Gatsby will register your custom service worker.

## Removing the service worker

If you would like to fully remove the service worker from your site, you can use the plugin `gatsby-plugin-remove-serviceworker` in place of `gatsby-plugin-offline`. See [the README for `gatsby-plugin-offline`](/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline/#remove) for instructions how to do this.
