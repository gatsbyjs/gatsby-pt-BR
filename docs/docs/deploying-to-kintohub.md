## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you already have a Gatsby project to deploy. If you need a project, you can use the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) or KintoHub's template [Gatsby Template](https://github.com/kintohub/gatsby-example) before continuing.

## Setup

In order to deploy a Gatsby site on KintoHub, you will need to create and deploy a **KintoBlock** into an **Environment** (development, staging, production).

_Note: A **KintoBlock** is connected to a GitHub repository. Accessing the kintoblock page will allow you to build, manage or tags any branches of your repository._

### Create a KintoBlock

1. Register on [KintoHub](https://beta.kintohub.com).
2. Create a new **KintoBlock** of type **Website** and give KintoHub permission to access your GitHub repo.
3. Select your GitHub repo from the list and press **Continue**.
4. Choose **Static from Build** with the following values:

   |                         |                                                            |
   | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Name**                | `Gatsby Website` (or your own name)                        |
   | **Language**            | `Node.js`                                                  |
   | **Version**             | `latest` (or your own node.js version)                     |
   | **Build Command**       | `npm install && npm run build` (or your own build command) |
   | **Build Output Folder** | `public` (or your own output directory)                    |

5. Press **Create Website**.

The build will automatically start on the default GitHub branch of your repository.
Wait for your build to be successful (green).

#### Multiple Branches

When you create a new **KintoBlock**, KintoHub imports all your branches and you can access them from your kintoblock page (new branches will also be automatically picked up).
You can switch from one branch to another by pressing the branch name on the side panel on the left.

#### Continuous Integration

By default, KintoHub will build all the changes you push on your default branch.
If you want to disable it:

1. Disable the toggle **Build New Commits**.
2. Press **Save Changes**.

Your new changes will not be automatically picked up anymore and you will have to press **Build Latest Commit** to trigger a build.

### Deploy your KintoBlock

From your KintoBlock page, you will need to deploy your website first before accessing it.

1. Press **Deploy Now** and then **New Project**.
2. You can change the default values (optional).
3. Press **Create New Project**.

The deployment will start.
Wait for it to be successful (green).

_Note: you can disable Continuous Deployments for future builds._
