Os plugins do Gatsby são pacotes Node.js que implementam APIs do Gatsby. Para sites maiores e mais complexos, plugins permitem modularizar sua customização do site em plugins específicos do site.

<!-- There are many types of Gatsby plugins, including [data sourcing](/plugins/?=gatsby-source), [SEO](/plugins/?=seo), [responsive images](/packages/gatsby-image/?=gatsby-image), [offline support](/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline/), [Sass support](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/), [sitemaps](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sitemap/), [RSS feeds](/packages/gatsby-plugin-feed/), [TypeScript](/packages/gatsby-plugin-typescript/), [Google Analytics](/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-analytics/), and more. You can also [make your own plugins](/docs/creating-plugins/)!

Gatsby themes are a type of plugin that include a `gatsby-config.js` file and add **pre-configured** functionality, data sourcing, and/or UI code to Gatsby sites. To learn more about theme use cases and APIs, check out the [themes section of the docs](/docs/themes/). To learn about how plugins differ from themes and starters refer to the [Plugins, Themes, & Starters conceptual guide](/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/).
