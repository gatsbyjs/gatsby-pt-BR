title: Adding Markdown Pages
---

Gatsby can use Markdown files to create pages in your site.
You add plugins to read and understand folders with Markdown files and from them create pages automatically.

Here are the steps Gatsby follows for making this happen.

1.  Read files into Gatsby from the filesystem
2.  Transform Markdown to HTML and [frontmatter](#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) to data
3.  Add a Markdown file
4.  Create a page component for the Markdown files
5.  Create static pages using Gatsby's Node.js `createPage` API

## Read files into Gatsby from the filesystem

Use the plugin [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/#gatsby-source-filesystem) to read files.

### Install

`npm install --save gatsby-source-filesystem`

### Add plugin

**NOTE:** There are two ways to add a plugin in `gatsby-config.js`. Either you can pass a string with the plugin name or in case you want to include options, pass an object.

Open `gatsby-config.js` to add the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin. Now pass the object from the next block to the `plugins` array. By passing an object that includes the key `path`, you set the file system path.

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
    options: {
      name: `markdown-pages`,
      path: `${__dirname}/src/markdown-pages`,
    },
  },
]
```

Completing the above step means that you've "sourced" the Markdown files from the filesystem. You can now "transform" the Markdown to HTML and the YAML frontmatter to JSON.

## Transform Markdown to HTML and frontmatter to data using `gatsby-transformer-remark`

You'll use the plugin [`gatsby-transformer-remark`](/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) to recognize files which are Markdown and read their content. The plugin will convert the frontmatter metadata part of your Markdown files as `frontmatter` and the content part as HTML.

### Install transformer plugin

`npm install --save gatsby-transformer-remark`

### Configure plugin

Add this to `gatsby-config.js` after the previously added `gatsby-source-filesystem`.

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
    options: {
      path: `${__dirname}/src/markdown-pages`,
      name: `markdown-pages`,
    },
  },
  `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
]
```

## Add a Markdown file

Create a folder in the `/src` directory of your Gatsby application called `markdown-pages`.
Now create a Markdown file inside it with the name `post-1.md`.

### Frontmatter for metadata in Markdown files

When you create a Markdown file, you can include a set of key value pairs that can be used to provide additional data relevant to specific pages in the GraphQL data layer. This data is called frontmatter and is denoted by the triple dashes at the start and end of the block. This block will be parsed by `gatsby-transformer-remark` as `frontmatter`. The GraphQL API will provide the key value pairs as data in your React components.

```markdown:title=src/markdown-pages/post-1.md
---
path: "/blog/my-first-post"
date: "2019-05-04"
title: "My first blog post"
---
```

What is important in this step is the key pair `path`. The value that is assigned to the key `path` is used in order to navigate to your post.

## Create a page template for the Markdown files

Create a folder in the `/src` directory of your Gatsby application called `templates`.
Now create a `blogTemplate.js` inside it with the following content:

```jsx:title=src/templates/blogTemplate.js
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export default function Template({
  data, // this prop will be injected by the GraphQL query below.
}) {
  const { markdownRemark } = data // data.markdownRemark holds your post data
  const { frontmatter, html } = markdownRemark
  return (
    <div className="blog-post-container">
      <div className="blog-post">
        <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <h2>{frontmatter.date}</h2>
        <div
          className="blog-post-content"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query($path: String!) {
    markdownRemark(frontmatter: { path: { eq: $path } }) {
      html
      frontmatter {
        date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
        path
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Two things are important in the file above:

1.  A GraphQL query is made in the second half of the file to get the Markdown data. Gatsby has automagically given you all the Markdown metadata and HTML in this query's result.

    **Note: To learn more about GraphQL, consider this [excellent resource](https://www.howtographql.com/)**

2.  The result of the query is injected by Gatsby into the `Template` component as `data`. `markdownRemark` is the property that you'll find has all the details of the Markdown file. You can use that to construct a template for your blog post view. Since it's a React component, you could style it with any of the [recommended styling systems](/docs/styling/) in Gatsby.

### Create static pages using Gatsbyâ€™s Node.js `createPage` API

Gatsby exposes a powerful Node.js API, which allows for functionality such as creating dynamic pages. This API is available in the `gatsby-node.js` file in the root directory of your project, at the same level as `gatsby-config.js`. Each export found in this file will be run by Gatsby, as detailed in its [Node API specification](/docs/node-apis/). However, you should only care about one particular API in this instance, `createPages`.

Use the `graphql` to query Markdown file data as below. Next, use the `createPage` action creator to create a page for each of the Markdown files using the `blogTemplate.js` you created in the previous step.

**NOTE:** Gatsby calls the `createPages` API (if present) at build time with injected parameters, `actions` and `graphql`.

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
const path = require(`path`)

exports.createPages = async ({ actions, graphql, reporter }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions

  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/blogTemplate.js`)

  const result = await graphql(`
    {
      allMarkdownRemark(
        sort: { order: DESC, fields: [frontmatter___date] }
        limit: 1000
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            frontmatter {
              path
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  // Handle errors
  if (result.errors) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild(`Error while running GraphQL query.`)
    return
  }

  result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges.forEach(({ node }) => {
    createPage({
      path: node.frontmatter.path,
      component: blogPostTemplate,
      context: {}, // additional data can be passed via context
    })
  })
}
```

This should get you started on some basic Markdown functionality in your Gatsby site. You can further customize the frontmatter and the template file to get desired effects!
