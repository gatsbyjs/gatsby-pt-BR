title: Programmatically Creating Pages
---

Sometimes you want to be able to programmatically access data from
files in `src/pages/` or create pages using MDX content that lives at
arbitrary locations outside of `src/pages/` or in remote CMSes.

For instance, let's say you have a Gatsby website, and you want to add
support for MDX so you can start your blog. The posts will live in
`content/posts/`. You can do this with the help of
`gatsby-source-filesystem` and [`createPages`](/docs/node-apis/#createPages) in
`gatsby-node.js`.

## Source MDX pages from the filesystem

To let Gatsby know that you'll be working with MDX content you need to
add `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to the plugins array in your `gatsby-config.js`
file.

You'll need to use `gatsby-source-filesystem` and tell it to source
"posts" from a folder called `content/posts` located in the project's
root.

> **Note**: `gatsby-plugin-mdx` uses `.mdx` by default as a file extension to
> recognize which files to use. You can also [use `.md` as a file
> extension](/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx#extensions) if you want.

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // Add support for *.mdx files in gatsby
    "gatsby-plugin-mdx",

    // Add a collection called "posts" that looks
    // for files in content/posts/
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: "posts",
        path: `${__dirname}/content/posts/`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

You can read about
[`gatsby-source-filesystem`](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem)
if you'd like to learn more.

## Add MDX files

Before you can write any GraphQL queries and programmatically create
pages, you need to add some content.

Make a folder called `content/posts` and create two files in it called
`blog-1.mdx` and `blog-2.mdx`. You can do this on the command line in
a terminal by using the following commands from the root of your
project.

```shell
mkdir -p content/posts
touch content/posts/blog-{1,2}.mdx
```

> **Note**:
> `mkdir -p path/to/a/directory` will create every folder in the path if
> it does not exist.
>
> `touch <filename>` will create an empty file named `<filename>`. The
> brackets (`{}`) are [an
> expansion](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083399683932868609?s=19)
> which means you can create multiple files in one command.

Open up each of the files you just created and add some content.

```mdx:title=blog-1.mdx
---
title: Blog Post 1
---

Trying out MDX
```

```mdx:title=blog-2.mdx
---
title: Blog Post 2
---

Gatsby is the best
```

## Generate slugs

Since MDX posts are being sourced outside of `src/pages`, each post
needs to be given a slug which tells Gatsby the URL to render to.

If you want to set the URLs in your frontmatter, you can skip this step.

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
const { createFilePath } = require("gatsby-source-filesystem")

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions

  // you only want to operate on `Mdx` nodes. If you had content from a
  // remote CMS you could also check to see if the parent node was a
  // `File` node here
  if (node.internal.type === "Mdx") {
    const value = createFilePath({ node, getNode })

    createNodeField({
      // Name of the field you are adding
      name: "slug",
      // Individual MDX node
      node,
      // Generated value based on filepath with "blog" prefix. you
      // don't need a separating "/" before the value because
      // createFilePath returns a path with the leading "/".
      value: `/blog${value}`,
    })
  }
}
```

The `value` in the `createNodeField` call is the URL you'll use later
to set up our page. `/blog${value}` is a [template
string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
that will result in:

- blog-1.mdx => http://localhost:8000/blog/blog-1/
- blog-2.mdx => http://localhost:8000/blog/blog-2/

[`createFilePath`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=gatsby-source#createfilepath)
is a function from `gatsby-source-filesystem` that translates file
paths to usable URLs.

[`onCreateNode`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#onCreateNode)
is a Gatsby lifecycle method that gets called whenever a new node is
created. In this case only `MDX` nodes are touched.

## Create pages from sourced MDX files

In order to create pages from the sourced MDX files, you need
to construct a query that finds all MDX nodes and pulls out
the `slug` field added earlier.

> **Note**: You can open up a GraphiQL console for query testing
> in your browser at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

```graphql
query {
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        fields {
          # Slug field created in the last section
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you skipped the last step and want to use frontmatter for your
slugs instead of the generated field, replace `fields` with `frontmatter`.

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
const path = require("path")

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter }) => {
  // Destructure the createPage function from the actions object
  const { createPage } = actions

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            fields {
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  if (result.errors) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild('ðŸš¨  ERROR: Loading "createPages" query')
  }

  // Create blog post pages.
  const posts = result.data.allMdx.edges

  // you'll call `createPage` for each result
  posts.forEach(({ node }, index) => {
    createPage({
      // This is the slug you created before
      // (or `node.frontmatter.slug`)
      path: node.fields.slug,
      // This component will wrap our MDX content
      component: path.resolve(`./src/components/posts-page-layout.js`),
      // You can use the values in this context in
      // our page layout component
      context: { id: node.id },
    })
  })
}
```

[createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages)
API.

## Make a template for your posts

You can create a file called `posts-page-layout.js` in `src/components` - this component
will be rendered as the template for all posts. There's a component,
`MDXRenderer` which is used by `gatsby-plugin-mdx` that will be used to render any
programmatically accessed MDX content.

For now, to update imports within .mdx files, you should rerun your Gatsby development environment. Otherwise, it will raise a `ReferenceError`. To import things dynamically, you can use the `MDXProvider` component and provide it all the common components you'll be using, such as `Link`.

First, create a component that accepts the queried MDX data (which will be
added in the next step).

```jsx:title=src/components/posts-page-layout.js
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react"
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

const shortcodes = { Link } // Provide common components here

export default function PageTemplate({ data: { mdx } }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXProvider components={shortcodes}>
        <MDXRenderer>{mdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
      </MDXProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then, write a query that uses `id` which is passed through the
`context` object in `createPage`. GraphQL requires you to declare
the type of arguments at the top of the query before they're used.

```jsx:title=src/components/posts-page-layout.js
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      frontmatter {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

When you put the component and page query all together, the
component should look like:

```jsx:title=src/components/posts-page-layout.js
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx"

export default function PageTemplate({ data: { mdx } }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRenderer>{mdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
    </div>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      frontmatter {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

That's it, you're done. Run `gatsby develop` and enjoy your new MDX
powers.

Now you have all the pieces you need to programmatically create pages
with Gatsby and `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. You can check out our other guides to find out
more about all of the cool stuff you can do with `gatsby-plugin-mdx`.

## Bonus: Make a blog index

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
import React from "react"
import { Link, graphql } from "gatsby"

const BlogIndex = ({ data }) => {
  const { edges: posts } = data.allMdx

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Awesome MDX Blog</h1>

      <ul>
        {posts.map(({ node: post }) => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link to={post.fields.slug}>
              <h2>{post.frontmatter.title}</h2>
            </Link>
            <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query blogIndex {
    allMdx {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          excerpt
          frontmatter {
            title
          }
          fields {
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

export default BlogIndex
```
