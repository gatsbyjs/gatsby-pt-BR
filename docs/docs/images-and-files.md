title: Images, Files & Video in Gatsby
---

Gatsby provides multiple solutions for adding images, video, and files to your projects. And a pro tip: you don't necessarily have to use GraphQL! From [imports](/docs/importing-assets-into-files/) and use of the [static folder](/docs/static-folder/) to dynamic queries with [Gatsby Image](/docs/using-gatsby-image/) to prevent image bloat, you've got options.

This section will walk you through several common patterns for handling media with Gatsby, where you can learn about the pros and cons of each method.
