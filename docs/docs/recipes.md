<!-- Basic template for a Gatsby recipe:

## Task to accomplish.
1-2 sentences about it. The more concise and focused, the better!

### Prerequisites
- System/version requirements
- Everything necessary to set up the task
- Including setting up accounts at other sites, like Netlify
- See [docs templates](/docs/docs-templates/) for formatting tips

### Directions
Step-by-step directions. Each step should be repeatable and to-the-point. Anything not critical to the task should be omitted.

#### Live example (optional)
A live example may not be possible depending on the nature of the recipe, in which case it is fine to omit.

### Additional resources
- Tutorials
- Docs pages
- Plugin READMEs
- etc.

See [docs templates](/docs/docs-templates/) in the contributing docs for more help.

Desejando um meio termo entre ler os [tutoriais completos](/tutorial/) e rastrear os [docs](/docs/)? Aqui est√° um livro de receitas orientadoras sobre como construir coisas, no estilo Gatsby.

## [1. Pages and layouts](/docs/recipes/pages-layouts)

Add pages to your Gatsby site, and use layouts to manage common page elements.

[Starters](/docs/starters/) are boilerplate Gatsby sites maintained officially, or by the community.

- [Using a starter](/docs/recipes/working-with-starters#using-a-starter)

## [4. Working with themes](/docs/recipes/working-with-themes)

A Gatsby theme lets you centralize the look-and-feel of your site. You can seamlessly update a theme, compose themes together, and even swap out one compatible theme for another.

- [Creating a new site using a theme](/docs/recipes/working-with-themes#creating-a-new-site-using-a-theme)
- [Creating a new site using a theme starter](/docs/recipes/working-with-themes#creating-a-new-site-using-a-theme-starter)
- [Building a new theme](/docs/recipes/working-with-themes#building-a-new-theme)

## [5. Sourcing data](/docs/recipes/sourcing-data)

Pull data from multiple locations, like the filesystem or database, into your Gatsby site.

- [Adding data to GraphQL](/docs/recipes/sourcing-data#adding-data-to-graphql)
- [Sourcing Markdown data for blog posts and pages with GraphQL](/docs/recipes/sourcing-data#sourcing-markdown-data-for-blog-posts-and-pages-with-graphql)

- [Sourcing content from Drupal](/docs/recipes/sourcing-data#sourcing-content-from-drupal)

## [6. Querying data](/docs/recipes/querying-data)

Gatsby lets you access your data across all sources using a single GraphQL interface.

- [Querying data with a Page Query](/docs/recipes/querying-data#querying-data-with-a-page-query)
- [Querying data with the StaticQuery Component](/docs/recipes/querying-data#querying-data-with-the-staticquery-component)
- [Querying data with the useStaticQuery hook](/docs/recipes/querying-data/#querying-data-with-the-usestaticquery-hook)

- [Querying data client-side with fetch](/docs/recipes/querying-data#querying-data-client-side-with-fetch)

## [7. Working with images](/docs/recipes/working-with-images)

Access images as static resources, or automate the process of optimizing them through powerful plugins.

- [Import an image into a component with webpack](/docs/recipes/working-with-images#import-an-image-into-a-component-with-webpack)

## [8. Transforming data](/docs/recipes/transforming-data)

Transforming data in Gatsby is plugin-driven. Transformer plugins take data fetched using source plugins, and process it into something more usable (e.g. JSON into JavaScript objects, and more).

- [Transforming Markdown into HTML](/docs/recipes/transforming-data#transforming-markdown-into-html)
- [Transforming images into grayscale using GraphQL](/docs/recipes/transforming-data#transforming-images-into-grayscale-using-graphql)
