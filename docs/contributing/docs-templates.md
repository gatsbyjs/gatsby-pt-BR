title: Docs Templates
---

Docs reference guides, recipes, and tutorials teach Gatsby concepts to users with a variety of learning styles and skill-sets. _It's the Gatsby way of writing learning materials._

Here are some things to keep in mind when deciding where to contribute to Gatsby:

- [Blog posts](/contributing/docs-contributions#contributing-to-the-blog) are primarily made for case studies and time-sensitive storytelling.
- [Reference guides](#reference-guides), in contrast, are evergreen -- or continually relevant -- and discoverable documentation articles that go beyond any one case study or situation.
  - [Other guides](#other-types-of-guide-articles) add documentation for specific purposes like the API reference, Conceptual Guide, Gatsby Internals, and more.
- [Recipes](#recipes) add concise, discoverable, and easy-to-follow instructions for common Gatsby tasks. They are smaller units than tutorials.
- [Tutorials](#tutorials) should provide step-by-step guidance for Gatsby workflows, listing all pre-requisites and not assuming knowledge or skipping steps.

When writing (or reviewing) learning materials that show Gatsby users how to complete tasks, you are expected to **test out any code examples or steps to ensure they work**. This can also help with writing in your own words, rather than copying from other sources. If you have a demo project or code example that strengthens docs and you don't know where to put it, mention it to the Gatsby Learning team in a PR.

### Why use templates?

Here are templates (models) to follow when contributing to Gatsby docs to ensure that the docs accomplish their purpose. If you have a good reason to deviate from the following template structures, mention those reasons in the PR so others can give proper feedback.

## Reference guides

### What are reference guide articles?

Reference guide articles cover discrete topics as documentation with links to other resources. A reference guide explains a Gatsby concept or technique without the step-by-step context provided by a tutorial or recipe.

Reference guide sections provide canonical information on how and why to build things with Gatsby for a variety of scenarios. Reference material should list text headings for each section of a guide, rather than "steps 1-5" like a tutorial.

#### Other types of guide articles

The Gatsby docs include multiple types of guides. They mostly follow the same format, but some docs will have a slightly different purpose and/or audience.

- [Reference Guides](/docs/guides/): explanations of Gatsby site development techniques and common workflows. These should be written for all skill-levels.
- [API Reference](/docs/api-reference/): technical docs on API methods and options, common files, and links to additional resources and explanations.
- [Releases & Migration](/docs/releases-and-migration/): release notes and guides on how to upgrade Gatsby and third-party packages.
- [Conceptual Guides](/docs/conceptual-guide/): high-level docs to explain important Gatsby concepts and philosophies.
  - As an example, "Plugins, Themes, and Starters" would be an overarching concept article, with individual reference guide sections for Plugin, Theme, and Starter docs.
- [Gatsby Internals](/docs/gatsby-internals/): previously titled Behind the Scenes, these docs go in depth into how Gatsby works under the hood.
- [Using Gatsby Professionally](/docs/using-gatsby-professionally/): articles on winning over stakeholders, working in larger organizations, and building a career as a Gatsby developer.

### What should a reference guide be about?

We need guide articles to describe every concept and task you can accomplish with Gatsby.

Each guide article should explain exactly one concept and that concept should be apparent from the article's title. [Overview guides](#reference-guide-overview) can list child pages to present multiple ways of getting a job done while limiting the scope of each individual article (e.g. Styling Your Site, Using Layout Components, Standard Global CSS Files, etc.)

### Near-perfect example of a reference guide

[Linking Between Pages](/docs/linking-between-pages/)

### What if I want to include multiple tasks and concepts in a reference guide?

If you find yourself wanting to include multiple related topics in one article, consider splitting each into its own individual guide and referencing the other topics under sections called “Prerequisites” and/or "Other Resources" sections in the related guide articles.

It’s more ideal to have many articles that cover a broad range of technical topics rather than smashing too many topics into one article.

If you find yourself wanting to teach the reader how to accomplish a series of related tasks, you might want to write a tutorial. For short and super common how-to instructions for a single task, a recipe may work best.

### When to write a reference guide vs. a tutorial, vs. a recipe?

[Reference guide articles](#reference-guide-template) cover discrete topics as documentation while linking to other resources and guides. A reference guide explains a task or concept without the step-by-step context provided by a tutorial or recipe.

[Tutorials](#tutorial-template) guide users through a series of related tasks they can string together successfully. Listing prerequisites up front and limiting distractions or links away from the instructions can make a focused tutorial.

[Recipes](#recipe-template) are a happy medium between step-by-step tutorials and crawling the full reference guides, by providing step-by-step guidance for short, common Gatsby tasks. They live in the Recipes section of the docs.

### How to choose a reference guide topic?

Guide topics should be chosen based on these priorities:

1.  [Stub articles](/contributing/stub-list/) (docs that already exist on the site but don't have content in them yet)
2.  Articles with the [help wanted and type:documentation](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22type%3A+documentation%22) labels on GitHub
3.  Articles related to improving [key learning workflows](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13708)
4.  Articles listed in the "Backlog" or "To prioritize" sections of the [Learning / Devrel Roadmap](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/projects/10) on GitHub
5.  Articles that you or other community members would like to see

### Length of a reference guide

Ideally, a guide's table of contents would fit above the fold on a desktop computer screen. This means the outline is easily consumable, so the person can quickly determine if that section of the docs contains the information they need to complete a task.

The content of a reference guide should provide just enough information to be actionable. Linking out to other materials and guides outside of Gatsby's core concepts is recommended to limit the scope to critical and unique parts of Gatsby development.

### Reference guide template

You can copy and paste the markdown text below and fill it in with your own information. See the docs contributions guide for information about [structuring accessible headings](/contributing/docs-contributions#headings).

```markdown
---
title: Querying Data with GraphQL
---

## Introductory paragraph

The introductory paragraph should be a 1-2 sentence explanation of the main
topic and answer the following question:

What is the purpose of this guide?

## Prerequisites (if any)

If applicable, list any prerequisites to reading and understanding your article. Does the reader need to read another document first, install a particular plugin, or already know a certain skill? List those things here.

## The facts

What are the facts you know about the topic of this guide?

Keep paragraphs short (around 1-4 sentences). People are more likely to read
several short paragraphs instead of a huge block of text.

## Example

Readers will likely use doc articles as a quick reference to look up syntax.
Articles should have a basic, real-world example that shows common use cases of its syntax.

Provide at least one example of how the task gets accomplished. A code snippet is ideal, in this format:

    code snippet

//See this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) on how to format code examples

## Gatsby advantages

Does Gatsby address this topic uniquely in some way? If so, state the unique advantages Gatsby provides to the user.

If there are disadvantages Gatsby has, state those here as well and any known bugs or issues the Gatsby community is working on.

## Other resources

If there are other resources you think readers would benefit from or next steps they might want to take after reading your article, add them at the bottom in an "Other Resources" section. You can also mention here any resources that helped you write the article (blog posts, outside tutorials, etc.).

- Link to a blog post
- Link to a YouTube tutorial
- Link to an example site
- Link to source code for a live site
- Links to relevant plugins
- Links to starters
```

## Reference guide overview

### Near-perfect example of a guide overview

[Deploying and Hosting](/docs/deploying-and-hosting/)

### What should a reference guide overview be about?

Each overview should give a short introduction of its section of the guides and list the relevant subtopics.

### Length of a reference guide overview

Ideally, a guide overview fits above the fold on a desktop computer screen. This means the outline is easily consumable, so the person can quickly determine if that section of the docs contains the information they need to complete a task.

### When should I create a new reference guide overview?

Guide overview articles are essentially new parent categories that help organize all the reference guides. Here’s how to decide if you should create a new reference guide overview:

1.  [Stub articles](/contributing/stub-list/) (docs that already exist on the site but don't have content in them yet)
2.  Article sections with the [help wanted and type:documentation](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22type%3A+documentation%22) labels on GitHub
3.  Article sections related to improving [key learning workflows](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13708), like "e-commerce"
4.  Article sections listed in the "Backlog" or "To prioritize" sections of the [Learning / Devrel Roadmap](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/projects/10) on GitHub
5.  Article sections that you or other community members would like to see

## Reference guide overview template

You can copy and paste the markdown text below and fill it in with your own information

```markdown
---
title: Section Title
---

The section overview should include a 2-5 sentence explanation of the category and answer the following questions:

- What is the main purpose of this section in the docs?

## Prerequisites (if any)

Assume the reader has basic programming knowledge such as the command line, code editors, and beginning familiarity with React and GraphQL concepts. Beyond that assumed knowledge, list any other prerequisites to reading and understanding your article. Does the reader need to read another document first, install a particular plugin, or already know a certain skill? List those things here.

<GuideList slug={props.slug} />

## Other resources

- Link to a recipe
- Link to a blog post
- Link to a YouTube tutorial
- Link to an example site
- Link to source code for a live site
- Links to relevant plugins
- Links to starters
```

## Recipes

[Docs Recipes](/docs/recipes/) should act as discoverable, concise instructions for completing common Gatsby tasks without having to navigate elsewhere. They live in the [Recipes section](/docs/recipes/) in the docs, the source of which can be found in the [`docs/docs/recipes.md` landing page](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/docs/recipes.md) and [`docs/docs/recipes/*` folder](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/docs/recipes/) in the GitHub repo.

A recipe should list requirements and include a few short instructions to complete a task. It should omit boilerplate and list only directly related, actionable instructions inline. Recipes are smaller units than tutorials, each limited to a single feature or task. Multiple recipes could be linked from a reference guide or tutorial, however the content should be consolidated in the Recipes section for discoverability. If a recipe is recorded as a video, it should be less than five or ten minutes long.

The components of a recipe are:

- Overview link on [`recipes.md`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/docs/recipes.md)
- The name of the recipe, which should describe a single task
- A 1-2 sentence description motivating what the recipe is for
- Prerequisites and requirements
- Step-by-step directions
  - Optional embedded examples
- Links to additional resources

Recipes should be short. This is accomplished by limiting steps to what is unique to the task at-hand; prerequisites and requirements should be mentioned but not include install steps for things like npm or Gatsby CLI. Linking to full reference guide, tutorial, or a working example can complete the loop for anyone who needs more help.

If you're finding a recipe is becoming too long to fit on the Docs Recipes page due to including many prerequisites or steps, consider writing a tutorial instead.

### Recipe categories

Grouping recipes by topic will allow users to navigate and learn by subject matter. As recipes following the new format are introduced, you might find a section needs an h2 heading added for the group. The older-style recipes should be gradually replaced with actionable recipes following the template below.

Recipes should fall into these categories to start (suggest your idea in a GitHub issue!):

- Pages/Layouts
- Styling
- Using a starter
- Using themes
- Sourcing data
- Querying data
- Images
- Transforming data
- Deploying

Here's a template for a new recipe category:

```markdown:title=docs/docs/recipes.md
## Category name
```

### Recipe parts

#### Overview link

To make sure your recipe is linked from the overview page, you must add it to the appropriate category in [`recipes.md`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/docs/recipes.md). Otherwise, it will be difficult for Gatsby users to find it, which isn't good for anyone!

#### Title and description

To help motivate the purpose of a recipe, its title should clearly indicate the task being covered; not just the tool or API being used. E.g. "Using the StaticQuery Component" is more descriptive than "StaticQuery".

Descriptions should be 1-2 sentences long and expand on the title to further motivate why someone would want to follow this recipe.

#### Prerequisites

Each recipe should include 2-5 requirements or prerequisites, some of which may not be explicitly required but are good to be aware of. These items should list any steps that must be done or checked before starting the recipe to keep it focused and succinct.

Each prerequisite should include only the _item_ or _thing_ needed, not the whole step (verbs like "installed").

Prerequisites example:

```markdown
- React and ReactDOM 16.8.0 or later (keeping Gatsby updated handles this)
- The [Rules of React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
```

#### Directions

The steps should list each part of the task in detail (omitting unrelated boilerplate or installation steps), and not skip or gloss over necessary details. Typically these steps are included with an ordered list. It's subjective whether to include a code snippet for each step, and will require your best judgement (ask for help in a PR if you're not sure). For some recipes, listing each individual step in text and including a single code snippet for the recipe makes sense to keep it short.

If a recipe issue recommends a live example such as a CodeSandbox embed, the recipe steps are the best place to include it.

#### Additional resources

This is the place to link to related docs, tutorials, and additional examples.

### Recipe template

When writing a recipe, try to include each of the below items wherever relevant.

````markdown:title=docs/docs/recipes.md
### Recipe name

#### Prerequisites

- A Gatsby site with two page components: `index.js` and `contact.js`
- The Gatsby <Link /> component
- The Gatsby CLI method `gatsby develop`

#### Directions

1. Open the index page component (src/pages/index.js), import the <Link />
   component from Gatsby, add a <Link /> component above the header, and give
   it a `to` property with the value of "/contact/" for the pathname:

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

export default () => (
  <div style={{ color: `purple` }}>
    <Link to="/contact/">Contact</Link>
    <p>What a world.</p>
  </div>
)
```

2. Run `gatsby develop` and navigate to the index page. You should have a link
   that takes you to the contact page when clicked!

#### Additional resources

- Related docs/materials to check out
- Any other demos
````

## Tutorials

In contrast to recipes and reference guides, tutorials are step-by-step instructions for a series of related Gatsby tasks. Tutorials are grouped into Gatsby Fundamentals and Intermediate Tutorials ("The Gatsby Tutorial"), as well as Advanced Tutorials which can be explored individually as needed.

### Near perfect example of a tutorial

[Main Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)

### What should a tutorial be about?

We need tutorials to guide users of all skill levels through performing a series of related tasks with Gatsby.

### How to choose a tutorial topic?

Topics should be chosen based on these priorities:

1.  Tutorials related to improving [key learning workflows](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13708)
2.  Tutorials listed in the "Backlog" or "To prioritize" sections of the [Learning / Devrel Roadmap](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/projects/10) on GitHub
3.  Tutorials with the [help wanted and type:documentation](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22type%3A+documentation%22) labels on GitHub
4.  Tutorials that you or other community members would like to see

## Length of a tutorial

If a tutorial is longer than 3 8.5x11” pages or has more than about 5 headers and you’re finding yourself creating a Table of Contents at the top, it will probably be easier to read and easier for readers to complete if you turn it into a multi-page tutorial, like the [main Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

If you have a tutorial that falls into this category, it is likely a big enough project that you’ll benefit from the feedback process provided by creating an [RFC (Request for Comments) document](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs).

## Tutorial template

You can copy and paste the markdown text below and fill it in with your own information.

```markdown
---
title: How to Create a Decoupled Drupal Site with Gatsby
---

## What’s contained in this tutorial?

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have done the following:

- learned how to **\_\_**
- built a \***\*\_\*\***
- used a **\_\_\_** with Gatsby

## Prerequisites (if any)

If applicable, list any prerequisites to reading and understanding your tutorial. Does the reader need to read another document first, install a particular plugin, or already know a certain skill? List those things here.

## Step 1

Keep paragraphs short (around 1-4 sentences). People are more likely to read
several short paragraphs instead of a huge block of text.

Readers will likely use doc articles as a quick reference to look up syntax.
Articles should have a basic, real-world example that shows common use cases of its syntax.

    code example

//See this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) on how to format code examples

## Step 2

Repeat the pattern found in step 1

## Step 3

Repeat the pattern found in other steps the other steps

## Step _n_

Include as many steps as you need. If there are more than 5-10 steps, it might be worth considering a multi-page tutorial to make it easier for the people to finish chunks of the tutorial.

## What did you just do?

In this tutorial, you did the following:

- learned how to **\_\_**
- built a \***\*\_\*\***
- used a **\_\_\_** with Gatsby

## What’s next

If there are more parts to the tutorial, link to the next step here.

## Other resources

If there are other resources you think readers would benefit from or next steps they might want to take after reading your article, add
them at the bottom in an "Other Resources" section. You can also mention here any resources that helped you write the article (blog posts, outside tutorials, etc.).

- Link to a blog post
- Link to a YouTube tutorial
- Link to an example site
- Link to source code for a live site
- Links to relevant plugins
- Links to starters

## Plugin README template

### Near-perfect example of a plugin README

[`gatsby-source-filesystem`](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/)

```markdown
## Description

Include a summary of what this plugin accomplishes. Is there a demo site that shows how this plugin operates? If so, include a link to the deployed demo site and/or its source code here.

Themes are considered plugins in the Gatsby ecosystem and should follow this README as well. Note that themes include multiple READMEs. One inside the theme directory with configuration instructions, one inside the example project directory, and one in the root of the repository which will follow this guide.

### Dependencies (optional)

Are there any plugins that must be installed in order to make this plugin work? If so, please include a list of those plugins and links to their pages here.

### Learning Resources (optional)

If there are other tutorials, docs, and learning resources that are necessary or helpful to someone using this plugin, please link to those here.

## How to install

Please include installation instructions here.

Gatsby documentation uses `npm` for installation. This is the recommended approach for plugins as well.

If the plugin is a theme that needs to use `yarn`, please point to [the documentation for switching package managers](/docs/gatsby-cli/#how-to-change-your-default-package-manager-for-your-next-project) in addition to the `yarn`-based instructions.

## Available options (if any)

## When do I use this plugin?

Include stories about when this plugin is helpful and/or necessary.

## Examples of usage

This usually shows a code example showing how to include this plugin in a site's `config.js` file.

    code example

//See this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) on how to format code examples.

This section could also include before-and-after examples of data when the plugin is enabled, if applicable.

## How to query for data (source plugins only)

If this is a source plugin README, source plugins ought to allow people to query for data within their Gatsby site. Please include code examples to show how to query for data using your source plugin.

If this is a theme that requires data in a specific format in order to match an existing query, include those examples here.

## How to run tests

## How to develop locally

## How to contribute

If you have unanswered questions, would like help with enhancing or debugging the plugin, it is nice to include instructions for people who want to contribute to your plugin.
