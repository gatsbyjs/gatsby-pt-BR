## O que constitui um evento Gatsby?

<!-- A community-organized Gatsby event can be a local meetup, a small conference, a “lunch and learn” with coworkers, or a larger event - as long as **it includes at least one Gatsby-focused presentation or discussion**. It’s up to you how many people you want to invite and how casual the environment. You can organize an event at your workplace or for the local community. -->
